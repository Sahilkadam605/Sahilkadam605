Namaste everyone let's continue my journey.

I learnt about Structure Of Internet. Kunal gave me very fantastic example for understanding the structure. Ha gave Amazon's order booking and shopping example. We all know what process runs after we ordered something gorom Amazon. That's how network works.

Very first we send a request to server for an example YouTube. Then YouTube will reach that server who has your thing. Then it will send to your computer's server after that your get it what needed.

After this there is something Ois model. It's stands for open system inter connection model.

There are 7 layers of open system interconnection model let's start

Application layer ,presentation layer ,session layer ,transportation layer ,network layer, data link layer ,physical layer.

When you send a data via application it means the layer of that application will send that particular data to present station layer. Now question is what does presentation ? In simple words presentation layer will convert your message into machine code.

The next one is session layer it is very complex for me because I didn't understand very well but still I will try to explain easily. Session layer is helps to setting and managing the terminal connection which was followed by this server. It means session layer is more likely to a bridge of user to this server before session layer is set we cannot do our work.

After that session layer will send the data to transportation layer. Transportation level basically it does transfer your data to your friend but it has three different ways to do it a very first is segment. This segment thing will gives that data port number and sequence number. We all already know that data will not send as a whole it will goes in a chunks right so everything part have a port number and sequence number for it will go as a sequence wise. This transportation layer also have some protocols like everyone has this layer have u d p and TCP protocol uddp means user datagram protocol and TCP means transmission control protocol.

Afterwards network layer will get the data this segment which was sent by transportation layer right something comes different because network layer will communicate with different computers. In that moment router is come router lives in this layer because the network layer is perform via router.

So what is function of network layer actually logical address is a function of network layer. We already new that every computer has its own IP address but in terms of network it is known as logical address.

Now network layer the IP address of sender and receiver to every segment and create IP packet. The reason of making IP packet of data because every data can reach to there destination easily.

Afterwards data link will receive the data. Data link communicate with computers directly. data link received data packet from network layer and this packets hold IP addresses of sender and receiver. Data link enter physical addresses into IP packets for framing the data.

Our computer have Mac addresses every device be used all they have different Mac addresses .

Afterwards physical layer is comes for converting this frame a data which was in binary form beds form into electrical signals.

So there another model which is TCP/ IP model it is not completely difference from OS I model but it's quite different. It is 5 layers actually model is more theory concert it is actually a conceptual thing but TCP/IP model is more practical.

1\. Application layer.

Now I learnt so much about application layer like how it work why this layer exist and so much. Application is interaction between uses and the examples of application layer is WhatsApp Facebook etc and where it is derive into our devices right

So application layer have two parts client and server this two things called as processor. They communicate with each other.

So this is first one server and client architecture but there is another one. Which called peer to peer architecture.it is mostly used in offices ,schools.beacause every computer has same network.

I am done with today guys.Thank you so much kunal for providing such a valuable lecture.
