Namaste everyone today I will learn about detail coding Java. Started with the main function of Java whatever will be start it will be in that made function. A gives me a tip if I am creating any class make sure the first letter of that class should be a capital.

We created public class main().. At starting. The public keyword is a access modifier. Then he taught what is a function in short it is a collection of code. After he open terminal and open main function which contain Our program then it gives Java c. It will compiled in class code like bite code. Which showing in files section. If I send that class code with anyone it will run. That's why Java is independent lagunga.

Detailing about this things

Public class main{

Public static void main(string \[\] args) {

System. Out. Println("hello world");

Class is a collection of donation and groups. And whatever will be in class that called as methods.

Then there is void which is used for not giving any return value.

I practiced to print hello word. It took 20 min. Yes, i was done very silly mistake. I was writing Main using uppercase M. And i wrote system using lowercase s.i shail should have to do opposite.

Then there is package com thing or is used as a folder for privac Actually system is a class and out is variable. Which is under the print stream.

So for today's lecture I only learnt about output part tomarow i will be going to learnt input part.

Thank you Kunal. #WeMakeDevs
