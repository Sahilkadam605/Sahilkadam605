Namaste everyone, I learnt all about java. Let see what I learnt

Kunal started from very basic of Java. It was so much information.i wasn't handled well. But yeah it was pretty cool.he told me the architecture of Java program. From starting to end. The whole process.

\[.JAVA FILE\]--Compiler--\[.CLASS FILE\]--Interepter--\[MACHINE CODE \]---&gt;This is how our java program execute. This is the whole process of Java. Actually I did not wrote every thing. After this diagram he told me the work of every step that comes into Java architect.

1ST.STEP

â€¢.java file--&gt;this is a human readable file. it is called source code.(when we type our code in any compiler that is called source code.

2ND STEP

â€¢compiler--&gt;after the program written the compiler will compiled entire file.

3RD STEP

â€¢.Class file--&gt;the compiler send your source code into .class file. This file known as bite code.(this is something unique for me. I learnt basic about c++ but this type of file i am hearing first time. This file has so important task. The compiler will not send our code direct into machine code like c++and c language's compiler do.

\--your source code will not run directly on the system. -- we need Java virtual Machine to run your code which is compiled yet.

\--that is why Java is platform independent.

4RTH STEP

â€¢interrupter---&gt;this interpreter will cut your code line by line.

5TH STEP

â€¢ MACHINE CODE---&gt;this machine code is form of zero and one this language or code only understand computer.

Now there are so many questions like what is byte code ?what is interruptor ? what is machine code? what is Java virtual Machine ? what is platform independent ? and many things. But we will cover all this questions one by one.

â€¢the bite code will run on any system if you are using Mac it does not stop you to run on windows ,Linux.

So Architecture of Java program is like, first Java development kit means your source program.then it's compiled by Java c in byte code. After it goes in Java virtual Machine and it check errors if there is no error then it will go into Java runtime environment and it will execute.

So this all things I mentioned,i understood now than enough. I guess anyone who will read this. He can also able to understand atleast somewhat. Thank you Kunal Kushwaha for such a valuable lecture. Bye bye.
