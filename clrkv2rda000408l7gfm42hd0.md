Namastey everyone, I am sahil kadam who is trying to learn unity game development. So today I learn c# basics.i want to become a game programmer so a programming language is must. Specially c# beacuse it's use in unity engine.i learnt c++ basics already so it is not a deal for me. I just have to concentrate little bit to grasp c#. And i think I did it. I learnt variables, if else condition and datatypes. I was watching a YouTube course which is Microsoft course. My professor is Bob trapper. He taught me so nicely, he gave me some insights also. I will continue my learning. As I grow as I learn more and more i will write big blog
