#WeMakeDevs

Namaste everyone,I am sahil kadam.a newbie and enthusiastic person or student in Tech industry.Thanks to kunal kushwaha,for encouraging me to knowing fabulous benefits of learning public.

Actually I am so weak in communication game.specially when it's come in public. but, It's seems so simple for me. Beacuse most of the tasks will be via on social platform.

It means work as a backend person ðŸ˜„. Let me share with you,what are those learning ?

I have so many options for being a good public learner.

The very first is Twitter.

I think it's most favourite plaform for kunal.beacuse I heard so many benifits of it. So l also thought without thinking too much,let's explore Twitter.i download the app as soon as possible.but i faced so big problem.which was i couldn't able to use the Twitter.so again I visit on YouTube and a found kunal's video.(how to use Twitter for networking) something like that.

Then finnally i learnt.that was such a good feeling. I also tweet something,and as Kunal told that you will get feedbacks from others that will improve your knowledge. That happened and my little start is now continuing.I will definitely consistent in this task.once again thank you so much kunal brother.
