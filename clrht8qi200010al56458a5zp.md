#WeMakeDevs

Namaste everyone,I am sahil kadam.today i learnt very basics things about unity engine.actually i am not a therotical learner , i love to learn practically.so

lets get started.the very first thing is unity interface which is very siimple but at the same time little difficult.i got to know about three most important thing which is hireachy,inspector,game object.these three things are crucial .atleast its so common . at the very first,i decided to make a flaapy bird game.i thought that was so easy for me,but,i dont know how i shifted to a running game .

let me tell you what are those times where i stuck.

i stuck at how to start game development ? is it from videos or documentation or courses ? i started through videos and courses but unfortunately i coudnt get that help from those videos . so i decided to learn from chatgpt . this was so unique decision,becuase i didnt hear such way to learn.i ask so many questions . and i also get very satisfied answers.it provided me source code.and some of guidance.still i coudnt get the fundamentals of unity interface like how hireachy works what it do and how to manage game objects efficently. i hope that it will be clear very soon .thats all i wanted to share .i will also share my experience on different social platforms.
