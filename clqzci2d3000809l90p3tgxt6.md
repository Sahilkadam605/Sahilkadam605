Namaste everyone I am Sahil kadam. I started my Devops journey I hope that it is going to be very valuable for me. The very first lecture was about Git and Github and this is second one. Kunal taught me very well. At starting of the lecture I learnt about how internet was started. There was a tim who invented www site. The full form of www is world wide web. it is so amazing that I used to this website for very long time and I don't know about this fact.

After this point . I learnt about protocols. He told me that we use emails.it have a rules like which must be followed by that email, like it will do first step then second step and son on. And the very interesting part was all rules under by in internet society.which is a website ok.

After that he started client and server topic example about server and client,magine you are using your computer and you search something this called request. This request of your computer is trying to search via google.com so the request will do to Google's server and this server send response to your computer.

And one more thing Kunal told me that we all like countries and continents are connected via Internet but i knew this fact already but actually this is not the main fact. he told we are connected via wire of internet which is underground.under the sea.

I got to know the full form of TCP. TCP is a protocol and protocol handed by internet society. what is the definition or full form of TCP. Transmission control protocol many websites or many server. It gives you assurance of your data security when you send your data with anyone so this TCP will protect and control your data.

Next part was UDP this is called user datagram protocol. In the case of TCP it assure that your data will send 100% with whom ever you want to send but , UDP will not send your data 100%. For an example video conference or video call.

Then I learnt what is Http means-- hypertext transfer protocol.it is used by world wide web. It shows the format of your data.

Then i learnt what is IP address-- IP address is something I didn't understand but I try to explain when you type google.com in your computer it sent request to server and server understand the google.com through IP addresses of google.com. if you want to see your IP address give this command -- $curl if config.me-s.

If you have any internet security provider like Airtel jio idea etc. so this example will help you to understand.let say Airtel provides router.that router has global IP address. Any devices to will connect to that router they all have same IP address. IP address send the data of particular device. But which computer application needs that data in that particular device. This thing done by ports. For an example when you request anything from a particular application then your computer send that request to the server send response to your computer.but,computer needs decide which application had a request. This is so crucial movement for computer because any application have same IP address so for that reason computer portal number of that application is used.Every application has a different portal number.

If you are chatting with your friend then you have IP address and portal number your friend also have. The IP address will determine where are you located which computer you are using.but portal number decides which application you are using.

There are reserve ports number 0 from 1023. You cannot use any number between this range for your own application and from 1024 to 49152 these are also reserve but for specific applications like SQL mango db. Remaining you can use.

After this all things I learn types of networks which is LAN this is called local area network in the area it might be office in small houses you can connect thousands of computer via this network.

There are three types of networks local area network it is used in the small area via router Wi-Fi. Next one is metropalan area network it is used across the city. Next one is wide area network it is used across the country via optimal fibre cables which is present in the ocean..

In case of wide area network, there are synchro optical network. This network use to connect network via optical fibres cable. Second one is frame relay this thing connect local area networks to wider area network.

Next part is modem is used to collect digital data and convert into electrical data.

Now there are topologist first one is bus, ring ,star, tree ,mesh .

The bus topology is basically linear one line as 1 computer. And each computer connected to each other.

Ring topology it means the network size or connection is more likely to be a ring a circle every computer is connected to which computer but this is not similar to bus topology because bus topology there highly chances to connect different computer without disturbing those computer which are in the between of those.i am done with this. I will continue...

Thanking to kunal kushwaha for teaching very ðŸ˜Š
