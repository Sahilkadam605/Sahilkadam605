#WeMakeDevs

Hey everyone today I learn about flowchart and sudoku code this is a basic fundamental of logic. If I learn this very well I can improve my logic very soon.

Let's get started, in the flowchart is there are steps

1\. Start/stop --- oval shape is used to show.

2\. Input /output --- parallelogram is used to show.

3.processing ---Rectangle is used to show .

4.condition --- Rhombus is used.

5.flow/direction --- Arrow is used to show.

With the help of flowchart any problem I can solve correctly.I can put the logic and decide what logic is applied in this problem.

Actually I tried myself I took a one question which is check the number is prime or not and I tried but it was difficult I felt if this simple type of problem I cannot able to solve then what will happen next.

The next thing is another approach which is called sudoku code .

And this technique we do not worry about the algorithm the syntax or any other programming stuff in this technique we simplified all the things and explain like we are explaining with the non-tech person. We just write steps.

So ,yeah all this things I learnt.Thank you Kunal
