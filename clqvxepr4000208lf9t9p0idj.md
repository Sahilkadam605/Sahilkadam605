#WeMakeDevs

Namaste,I am sahil kadam. In today's lecture I learnt about git and GitHub.

â€¢what is git ?

Ans-- git is used for maintaining history of code base of any project.whatever you changed,how that changes made ,what are those changes and also who changed those code. After git intro I also learnt about GitHub.github is something more interesting to me.but not having laptop or computer,i couldn't able to installed that.and also i didn't spend to much time to attend lectures..beacuse without practicing those concepts.thats waste of time.so i decided to read git shit which was kunal given.

So let's continue what is GitHub

Ans-- GitHub is a platform on which git is used. Git is more likely a Technology which comes under in GitHub.it is not mandatory to used git via only from GitHub there are many others platform as well.but github is more simple i guess so.

After this introduction i checked out Git sheet.in that sheet he mentioned commands and some more stuffs. So I'll share with you about those things.

### INSTALLATION & GUIS

### With platform specific installers for Git, GitHub also provides the ease of staying up-to-date with the latest releases of the command line tool while providing a graphical user interface for day-to-day interaction, review, and repository synchronization.

### Honestly,i didn't understood very well.

After that I got to knew about setup,but I think that is completely practical knowledge I don't have to tell this to you here. But I introduced to commands of git. This commands used to change the computer's files.

Let me explain...

The very first command is

GiT log.

This command show the commited history for the currently active branch. ( Wherever you are in the moment..you can see via this comment)

The next one is

(Git log branchB..branchA)

Ans--show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB

(git log --follow \[file\])

Ans--show the commits that changed file, even across renames

(git diff branchB...branchA)

Ans--show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB

(git show \[SHA\])

Ans--show any object in Git in human-readable format

Unfortunately this things can't practiced.i hope I'll get computer as soon as possible.

Actually there are so many commands.i need to learn those things.

Thank you so much kunal for providing so much information.
